# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2026-08-29 (Quant Audit Round 2)

### Fixed
- **Critical (Q-5)**: Futures token was routed into option scorer as `strike=0 CE`, corrupting cross-strike coherence + `microstructure_weights` dataset. `on_tick_parsed` now skips `is_futures` tokens.
- **High (Q-4)**: TimeBar permission slope veto used absolute `±0.5` points (non-scale-invariant across NIFTY 25k vs SENSEX 78k). Now normalized to basis points via `last_price`, threshold `slope_veto_bps=2.0` (reproduces prior NIFTY behavior).
- **High (Q-7)**: Backtest used lot_size 25 (should be 65 NIFTY / 20 SENSEX) and flat ₹16.50 charges (no STT/exchange/SEBI/stamp/GST). Now SEBI-correct lot + `calculate_nse_option_charges` statutory model.
- **Medium (Q-6)**: FSM `last_trigger_ts` was reset every poll, so `trigger_age` was always ≈0 and the 3s/8s freshness windows were dead. Now `last_trigger_ts` records trigger inception (set on PRIME transition).
- **Medium (Q-3)**: ATR baseline used all 100 history bars (labeled "30-min"); now uses `atr_baseline_bars=30` correctly.

### Deferred (require data/calibration, not code)
- Q-1: scorer weight sign-contradiction (`tick_intensity +4.53` vs `pre_ret -1.77` × OTM returns negative) — needs OOS recalibration.
- Q-2: 9 computed-but-weightless features in hot path — retained for forward research data.
- R-1: bounded hot-path dict alloc (`otm_rets`, `features`) — refactor risk > benefit.
- A-1: `ARGUS.tick_compiler` cross-engine coupling — architectural.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `AegisGammaEngine.on_fill` signature mismatch with `AegisExecutionManager._chase_exit_thread` call (extra `sym` kwarg caused TypeError on every fill, potentially leaving zombie open positions).
- **Critical**: Exit chaser Step 3 incorrectly polled the cancelled order id; now captures new order id from aggressive exit placement and confirms fill before marking closed.
- **High**: Engine feedback latency (`signal_ts`) now uses the signal queue timestamp stored in trade context at entry, improving latency-decay accuracy.
- **Medium**: Bucket map literal `5_00_00_0.0` cleaned to `500_000.0` with comment.
- **Low**: Minute digest and IPC payload updated to reflect empirical microstructure scorer (removed misleading gamma-sum/hawkes-B zeros from console log; IPC retains keys for dashboard schema compatibility with zeros/scoring flags).

### Changed
- Updated `AEGIS/AEGIS V2.md` module map, ownership rules, and responsibility boundaries to match current flat repo structure with `core/` and `execution/` subdirectories.
- Engine now relies on `AEGIS.core.microstructure_scorer` for per-tick confidence scoring; hot path remains O(1) with zero allocation in scoring update.
- Execution manager uses shared `common.execution` components (capital engine, order lifecycle, strike selector) unchanged.
